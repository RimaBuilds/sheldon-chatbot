The chatbot is designed to simulate the character of Sheldon Cooper from the television show "The Big Bang Theory" Sheldon Cooper Chatbot The Sheldon Cooper Chatbot is a simple text-based chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate responses to user inputs. The chatbot is designed to simulate the character of Sheldon Cooper from the television show "The Big Bang Theory", as it generates responses in the format of "Sheldon Cooper says: [user input] Sheldon Cooper also says: [generated response]".

Getting Started To get started with the Sheldon Cooper Chatbot, you will need to have Python and Flask installed on your computer. You will also need to sign up for an OpenAI API key to use the GPT-3 language model.

Once you have these prerequisites installed and set up, you can run the chatbot by navigating to the directory where the app.py file is located and running the following command:

Copy code python app.py This will start the Flask app and allow you to access the chatbot in your web browser.

How It Works The Sheldon Cooper Chatbot is built using Python and Flask, a popular web development framework for Python. The Flask app has two routes - a home page and a chatbot page - and allows users to input text and receive a response from the chatbot. The app uses OpenAI's API key to generate responses from the GPT-3 language model, and also loads a text file containing a list of Sheldon Cooper quotes to use as training data.

How To Use It To use the Sheldon Cooper Chatbot, simply open your web browser and navigate to the URL where the Flask app is running. You will be taken to the home page, where you can learn more about the chatbot and how it works.

To access the chatbot, click on the "Chatbot" link in the navigation menu. This will take you to the chatbot page, where you can input text and receive a response from the chatbot.

When you input text into the chatbot, it will generate a response based on the GPT-3 language model and the training data from the Sheldon Cooper quotes. The response will be displayed on the screen in the format of "Sheldon Cooper says: [user input] Sheldon Cooper also says: [generated response]".
